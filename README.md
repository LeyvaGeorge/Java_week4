Option #2: Capture Grade Statistics Using For-loop
Write a program that will provide important statistics for the grades in a class. The program will utilize a for-loop to read ten floating-point grades from user input. Include code to prevent an endless loop. Ask the user to enter the values, then print the following data:

Average
Maximum
Minimum

Pseudocode
float total,maximum, minimum, numberOfGrades.
use a for loop to ask for x amount of grades.
- get user input of code
-- Checks that user inputs a valid value by do-while
- updates the total amount of grades to calculate for average at the end
